# Sample config to be used in conjunction with Blobifier Purge Tray, Bucket & Nozzle 
# Scrubber mod. Created by Dendrowen (dendrowen on Discord). The Macro is based on a 
# version, and Nozzle Scrubber is made by Hernsl (hernsl#8860 on Discord). The device is 
# designed around a Voron V2.4 300mm, but should work for 250mm and 350mm too. This 
# version only supports the assembly on the rear-left of the bed. If you decide to change 
# that, please consider contributing to the project by creating a pull request with the 
# needed changes.

# IMPORTANT: The rear-left part of your bed becomes unusable by this mod because the 
#            toolhead needs to lower down to 0. Be sure not to use the left-rear 130x35mm.

# The goals of this combination of devices is to dispose of purged filament during a 
# multicolored print without the need of a purge block and without the flurries of
# filament poops consuming your entire 3D printer room. The Blobifier achieves that by
# purging onto a retractable tray which causes the filament to turn into a tiny blob 
# rather then a large spiral. This keeps the waste relativly small. The bucket should be
# able to account for up to 200 filament swaps (for the 300mm V2).

# The Blobifier uses some room at the back-left side of your printer, depending on your
# printer limits and positions. (usually max_pos.y - toolhead_y and brush_start + 
# brush_width + toolhead_x). If you do place objects within this region, Blobifier will
# skip purging automatically. It does this by extending the EXCLUDE_OBJECT_* macro's, so
# make sure you have exclude objects enabled in your slicer.

# If your using Blobifier in conjunction with the filament cutter on the stealthburner
# toolhead, you can place the pin at max_pos.y - 7 (e.g., max pos y is 307, place it at
# 300). The pin will then poke through the cavity in your toolhead. (Be careful with 
# manually moving the toolhead. I have broken many filament cutter pins)

# It is advised to use the start_gcode from Happy Hare. Then you will be able to fully 
# and efficiently use this mod. Check the Happy Hare document at gcode_preprocessing.md 
# in the Happy Hare github for more details.
